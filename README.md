## Step 2: Locate and Extract the File


After your download is complete, locate the file in your downloads folder. If it comes in a compressed format, you will need to extract the file. Right-click on the downloaded file and select "Extract All." Choose a destination folder where you want to save the extracted files.


## Step 3: Run the Installer with Administrator Privileges


Now that you have the Quicken installer files ready, locate `installer.exe` in the extracted folder.
